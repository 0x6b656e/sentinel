- No more proposals, no generic budgets. In the following system there's only employees and employers
- Employees are defined at those who work for the network directly. 
- Employers are defined as those who manage employee (currently known as project manangers)
- Employers will be salaried, which is negotiated up front
- Employees will be salaried, which is also negotiated between the network and person
- Expenses are limited to repaying people for what they've spent and can also be used to hire external contractors directly (in the case of Ira Miller)
- This is a work in progress, I need to look at the proposal system and fit in the rest of everyone using it as well.
- I believe we should target ~30-50% of the budget to salary allocation. This will include "outside" projects as well.
- Amounts are not final and sort of random
